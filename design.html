                <h3>Desgin Document</h3>
                <p>When creating this website I wanted to give it a flowing feeling without any breaks or interuptions<br>
                I believe I accomplished this by the use of only one page for all of my ciphers.<br>
                This allows the user to scroll easly through the website to the desierd cipher.<br>
                The use of the navigation bar at the top with its smooth color transition animation when hovering <br>
                over each button helps push the flowing feeling I was going for.<br>
                I wanted my website to have a nice visual aspect aswell so after doing some research into the css coding language <br>
                I decided that one of the more appealing and proffesional looks from some of the websites i annalised is one called a parrallax scroll<br>
                which allows the developer to intergrate multiple pictures ontop top of on another within same page but with a smooth<br>
                transition inbatween them as the user scrolls down the page.<br>
                I used the small section space inbetween my chosen pictures to house my cipher's.<br><br>
                I intergrated a jumping feature into the navigation bar so that when a user wanted to make use<br>
                of a certain cipher they can easily jump directly to in from the top of the page, this navigation bar<br>
                also houses the button that is licked to this design document page which uses the same css stylesheet as<br>
                the main page. Giving it the whole websites pages same feel which i believe is crutial to a good user experience.<br><br>
                With alittle more time I would have liked to desgin my website in a way that would automaticcaly update the ciphers<br>
                so as the user typed into the text area of each encoder it would output the encoded message as they go along.<br>
                All in all I am happy with my website's desgin and am glad I put in the time and effert I did into reasearching css.</p>
